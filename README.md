# E-commerce Demo Task for Redtilt Solution Ltd

This is a demonstration of an e-commerce project. It includes a Splash Screen, a Product List page, a Product Details page, and a Checkout page with cart functionality.

The app is designed to load data once and store it locally, allowing users to access the data even when there is no internet connection.

Additionally, a basic logo animation has been implemented on the Splash Screen for a more engaging user experience.
